Intro
-------

ButtonBoard is designed for remotely running scripts and commands on a media server Mac. It was developed and tested on a Mac, but there is no reason it shouldn't run on Linux or possibly a Windows machine (with some work!)

It presents an iPhone Springboard-like grid of graphic buttons, and its primary client is intended to be an iOS device, but it seems to look great on Safari or Google Chrome on a PC. Each button press will launch a different custom script or program as defined by the user.

ButtonBoard supports a cookie-based authentication with a password, so once you log in, your cookie is good for a month.

Possible uses are controlling A/V equipment using IR, running batch scripts, restarting crashed server processes, media center control, etc.

This is not a commercial product and the end-user is expected to be able to edit the commands file ("cmds.xml"), write/edit the the underlying shell scripts (or apple script, or batch files), and find cool icon files :-)
Setup

Before you begin you need to install some python packages. Fortunately this is super-easy on Macs now:

sudo easy_install tornado
sudo easy_install elementtree

Now download the dmg file from the Google Code site (http://code.google.com/p/buttonboard), and extract the app. The app bundle was generated by the very handy "Platypus" app. Run the app, and a window should open up. You should now be able to navigate to http://{hostname}:8888, and the default password is "changeme"

Many of the default commands probably won't do anything on your system, but the iTunes buttons should work.
Configuring

    The app has now created a folder in ~/Library/Application Support/ButtonBoard. 


~/Library/
        |
        Application Support/
                |
                ----ButtonBoard/
                          |
                          |--default/
                          |    |----cmds.xml
                          |    |----images/
                          |    |----scripts/
                          |
                          |--user/
                          |    |----settings.xml
                          |    |----cmds.xml
                          |    |----images/
                          |    |----scripts/

All reference to folder names below are relative to this ButtonBoard folder.
Settings

You first want to edit user/settings.xml to change the password, and probably the port.

-------
Commands
-------

To add commands, first have a look at default/cmds.xml . This should give a good idea of the structure of the XML, and the file is well-documented. To add new commands, edit the XML in user/cmds.xml. This file has two parts, the details of each command, and then a layout, defining which command button goes in which row.

Here is sample command definition for playing a random album on iTunes, using some applescript I found on the net:

        <cmd name="random_album_itunes">
                <label>Random Album</label>
                <exec>itunes_random_album.as</exec>
                <icon>itunes.png</icon>
                <badge>shuffle-red.png</badge>
        </cmd>

All customizations should be done in the user folder, to prevent overwrites in later versions.

Scripts
-------

Any kind of script you can launch from the command-line is fair game. The XML supports passing in parameters if you want. You can put your scripts into user/scripts or just reference by absolute path anywhere on your filesystem. You can also call binaries directly, but this can be limiting since the commands are not then run in the context of shell.

-------
Icons
-------

Plunk your icons into user/images. You can using any type or size of image you want, but best to start with a square higher-res PNG with transparencies. When the app runs, it will automatically resize your images down to 128x128. The browser will take care of of the "button-ification" of the image, rounding the corners, and overlaying the mask, so no image editing needed.
