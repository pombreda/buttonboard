<!--  
This is the file to customize, adding your own commands, scripts and icons,
and customizing the layout

The first list of commmands contains the following elements for each command:

	name:	A unique command name

	label:	The label for the command shown below the icon

	exec:	The script to run on the server.  The actual execution will be done
				by a separate server script run by the user at startup/login.

	icon:	The icon to display. A good site to check out for making nice iPhone-y icons is:
				http://www.quirco.com/iPhoneIcon/

	confirm: True if a confirmation dialog is needed
	
	output:	True to display script output in a dialog box

Commands added in this custom file will be in addition to the original files

<cmds>
<!--
	<cmd name="foobar">
		<label>/bin/ls</label>
		<exec>/bin/ls</exec>
		<icon>/images/update_comix.png</icon>
		<output>true</output>
	</cmd>
-->
</cmds>

 
<!-- 
Since the buttons are layed out in lines of 4, they are grouped here that way for
the sake of clarity.  Please note the use of the special reserved command, "blank", used
as a space filler on the grid.

Any rows added in this custom file will supplant layout rows in the shipped file

<layout>
<!--

<buttonrow>
<item n="tv_power" />		<item n="stereo_power" />			<item n="foobar" />				<item n="stereo_vol_up" />
</buttonrow>

</layout>
